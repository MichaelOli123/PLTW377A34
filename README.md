## Download the Data Lab Student Files
Download the **Data Lab Student Files** listed in PLTW 3.7.7. Work through activities 3 and 4 with your team in a Google Document. Post your Google Docs to this assignment. Ensure that all team members' names are at the top of the document and clearly label each step.

### Files
The files are available [here](#).

I have provided two Google Doc templates for the project:
- [PLTW 3.7.7 Data Lab A3](#)
- [PLTW 3.7.7 Data Lab A4](#)

### Note on Code Files
The code files include a `.jar` file called `sinbad.jar`. You can configure Java to include the jar file from the command line. See, for instance:
- [sinbad.jar](#)

## Activity 3 Instructions
For steps 3 and 6, you may use **Replit** or **VS Code**, and you must provide your code in a GitHub repository. Include a `README.md` or `README.txt` file in your repository, along with a screenshot or two of your running code/output.

2. Identify a dataset that will help determine the answer to your question.
3. Create a class to model one entry of the identified dataset.
4. Write a program with a `main` method to read the data from the identified dataset into your program.
5. Utilize an `Array` or `ArrayList` and the created class to store data that has been read.
6. Write code to process the data and determine an answer to the identified question.
7. Graphically display your data to support your answer to your question.

### Additional Requirements
- Review the provided rubric/scoring guidelines to understand what you are expected to explain upon completion.
- Prepare for a presentation based on your group's program, which should include:
  - A brainstorming section.
  - A milestone chart.
  - A discussion of your data source and format, and how you accessed the data.
